<h3>MKBINGRAM(1)                                         MKBINGRAM(1)</h3>



<h3>NAME</h3>
       mkbingram - make binary N-gram from two arpa LMs

<h3>SYNOPSIS</h3>
       mkbingram 2gram.arpa rev3gram.arpa bingram

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
       mkbingram  makes a binary N-gram file for Julius from word
       2-gram and reverse word 3-gram LMs in ARPA  standard  for-
       mat.  Using the binary file, the initial startup of Julius
       becomes much faster.

       Note that the word 2-gram and reverse word  3-gram  should
       be  trained in the same corpus, same parameters (i.e. cut-
       off thresholds) and have the same vocabulary.

       mkbingram can read gzipped ARPA file.

       mkbingram that comes with Julius version 3.5 and later can
       generate  more size-optimized binary N-gram by using 24bit
       index instead of 32bit and 2-gram  backoff  data  compres-
       sion.  The byte order was also changed from 3.5 to use the
       system's native order by default.

       Although the old binary N-gram can  be  directly  read  by
       Julius, (in that case Julius performs on-line conversion),
       you can also update your  binary  N-gram  using  mkbingram
       using -d option.

       Please note that binary N-gram file converted by mkbingram
       of version 3.5 and later cannot be read  by  Julius/Julian
       3.4.2 and earlier.

<h3>OPTIONS</h3>
       2gram.arpa
              input word 2-gram file in ARPA standard format.

       rev3gram.arpa
              input  reverse word 3-gram in ARPA standard format.

       -d old_bingram
              input binary N-gram file (for conversion  from  old
              format).

       bingram
              output binary N-gram file.

<h3>EXAMPLE</h3>
       Convert ARPA files to binary format:

           % mkbingram ARPA_2gram ARPA_rev_3gram outfile

       Convert old binary N-gram file to new format:

           % mkbingram -d old_bingram new_bingram


<h3>USAGE</h3>
       You  can  specify  the  generated  binary  N-gram  file on
       Julius/Julian using option "-d".
