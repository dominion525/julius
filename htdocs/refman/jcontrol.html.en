<h3>JCONTROL(1)                                           JCONTROL(1)</h3>



<h3>NAME</h3>
       jcontrol  - simple program to control Julius / Julian mod-
       ule via API

<h3>SYNOPSIS</h3>
       jcontrol hostname [portnum]

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
       jcontrol is a simple console  program  to  control  julius
       running  on  other host via network API.  It can send com-
       mand to Julius, and receive messages from Julius.

       When invoked, jcontrol  tries  to  connect  to  Julius  or
       Julian  running  in  "module  mode" on specified hostname.
       After connection established, jcontrol waits for user com-
       mands from standard input.

       When  user  types a command to jcontrol, it will be inter-
       preted and corresponding  API  command  will  be  sent  to
       Julius.   When a message is received from Julius, its con-
       tent will be output to standard output.

       For details about the API, see the related documents.

<h3>OPTIONS</h3>

<h3>COMMANDS (COMMON)</h3>
       After  startup, the command string below can be input from
       stdin.

<h3>GRAMMAR COMMANDS (Julian)</h3>
       Below are Grammar-related command strings for Julian:

       changegram prefix
              Change  recognition  grammar  to  "prefix.dfa"  and
              "prefix.dict".   All  the  current grammars used in
              Julian are deleted and  replaced  to  the  specifed
              grammar.

       addgram prefix
              tell  Julian to use additional grammar "prefix.dfa"
              and "prefix.dict" for recognition.   The  specified
              grammars are added to the list of recognition gram-
              mars, and then activated.

       deletegram ID
              tell Julian to  delete  grammar  of  the  specified
              "ID".   The  deleted  grammar  will  be erased from
              Julian.  The grammar "ID" is sent  from  Julian  at
              each time grammar information has changed.

       deactivategram ID
              tell  Julian  to de-activate a grammar.  The speci-
              fied grammar will become temporary OFF, and skipped
              from recognition process.  These de-activated gram-
              mars are kept in Julian, and can  be  activated  by
              "activategram" command.

       activategram ID
              tell  Julian  to  activate  previously de-activated
              grammar.
