<a name="about_julius"><h2>About Julius</h2></a>

<b>"Julius"</b> is a high-performance, two-pass large vocabulary
continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) decoder software for
speech-related researchers and developers.  Based on word 3-gram and
context-dependent HMM, it can perform almost real-time decoding on
most current PCs in 20k word dictation task.  Major search techniques
are fully incorporated such as tree lexicon, N-gram factoring,
cross-word context dependency handling, enveloped beam search,
Gaussian pruning, Gaussian selection, etc.  Besides search efficiency,
it is also modularized carefully to be independent from model
structures, and various HMM types are supported such as shared-state
triphones and tied-mixture models, with any number of mixtures,
states, or phones.
Standard formats are adopted to cope with other free modeling toolkit
such as HTK, CMU-Cam SLM toolkit, etc.  
<p>
It also can be compiled as a grammar based recognizer <b>"Julian"</b>, that
supports multiple grammar recognition, dynamic grammar switching.
<!-- <p>
Julius has many functions for speech recognition system: full MFCC
support, MAP-CMN, spectral subtraction, low-latency audio buffering,
GMM-based input rejection, successive decoding, etc.
-->
<p>
The main platform is Linux and other Unix workstations, and also works
on Windows (SAPI/console).  Julius is distributed with open license together
with source codes, and has been used by many researchers and
developers in Japan.
<p>
Julius has been developed as a research software for Japanese LVCSR
since 1997, and the work was continued under IPA Japanese dictation
toolkit project (1997-2000), <a
href="http://www.lang.astem.or.jp/CSRC/">Continuous Speech Recognition
Consortium, Japan (CSRC)</a> (2000-2003) and currently <a

<a name="sapi"><h3>Get Julius for Windows SAPI</h3></a>

Julius for SAPI is MS Windows version of Julius/Julian which implements
Microsoft(R) Speech API (SAPI) 5.1.
You can use this version of Julius as a SAPI Voice Recognizer in
applications created for SAPI (e.g. Office XP).
<p>
The recent version is fully SAPI-5.1 compliant, and it also supports
SALT extension.
</p><p>
Julius for SAPI assumes that the user language and the application's
grammar is in Japanese.  So it is a little troublesome in case of the
other languages because Julius for SAPI does not know the
pronunciation of the words in a grammar.  If you define pronunciations
to each of these, it may work, but we have not tried it.

<a name="about_models"><h2>About Models</h2></a>

Since Julius itself is a language-independent decoding program, you
can make a recognizer of a language if given an appropriate language
model and acoustic model for the target language. The recognition accuracy
largely depends on the models.
<p>
Julius adopts
acoustic models in HTK ascii format, pronunciation dictionary in
almost HTK format, and word 3-gram language models in ARPA standard
format (forward 2-gram and reverse 3-gram trained from same corpus).
</p>
<p>
We had already examined English dictations with Julius, and another
researcher has reported that Julius has also worked well in English,
Slovenian (see pp.681--684 of Proc. ICSLP2002), French, Thai language,
and many other Languages.</p>

<a name="variants"><h3>Compile-time variants</h3></a>


<p>The default configuration of Julius is fine-tuned to do N-gram
based recognition with balance both speed and accuracy. However,
Julius has lots of compile-time options and runtime options to
select/modify each algorithm in detail.</p>

<p>Those variants of Julius can be compiled from the source codes by
setting several options to the "configure" script before compilation.
The variants are described below.</p>

<h4>Standard setup --- more accurate but time-consuming algorithm</h4>

<p>By default, the recognition algorithm of Julius is optimized for real-time
recognition. The set of algorithms chosen for that purpose
is named "fast". However, you can choose another set of algorithm to
put weight on accuarcy rather than speed, by specifying
"--enable-setup=standard" at "configure" script. The set is named
"standard".</p>

<p>Specifying the option may improve recognition accuracy for about
1% to 2% (and slightly more, depending on conditions), at a cost of
computation time up for about 20%. If you want to evaluate language or
acoustic model for research purpose, you should define this and also
set wider beam width for both 1st and 2nd pass to avoid search
error.</p>

<h4>Julian --- grammar-based recognizer</h4>

<p>"Julian", a
grammar-driven recognizer, can be compiled by specifying configure
option "--enable-julian". The grammar format is original, and grammar
compilation tools are also included in "gramtools/". See
"gramtools/00readme.txt" and <a href="grammar.html">"How to write a grammar for Julian"</a> for details.</p>

<p>Most of the run-time options are common with Julius. Please see
"Sample-julian.jconf" and manuals for a complete list of options.</p>

<h4>Multi-path version --- extended support for AM</h4>

<p>To make decoding faster, the default Julius has several limitations in the HMM
state transition: it allows only one transition from start node and to
end node within a model.</p>

<p>Thus, it does not support a multi-path model that has several
phoneme models in parallel, or a skip transition that has direct
transition from start node to end node to allow skipping of 
all the output state.</p>

<p>You can compile a Julius with "--enable-multipath" to overcome
these limitations and allow arbitrary transitions. The compiled one is
called "multi-path" version, and it can handle ANY arbitrary
transition, but the decoding speed
is slightly slower than the normal version.</p>

<h4>Other variants and functions</h4>

<p>Many algorithms can be
switched on or off by the configure options. Please do
"./julius/configure --help" and "./libsent/condifure --help" to get a
complete list of options for configure.</p>

<a name="changelog"><h2>ChangeLog</h2></a>

<u>3.5.3</u> (2006.12.29)
<pre>  o  Improved Performance:
     - acoustic computation optimized: now becomes 20%-40% faster!
     - optimize memory access: re-use work area of deleted hypothesis
       in the 2nd pass.
     - some memory allocation improvement on dictionary and word trellis.

  o  New Grammar Tools:
     - "dfa_minimize", "dfa_determinize" will minimize/determinize DFA.
        mkdfa.pl now calls dfa_mimize in it.
     - "slf2dfa": a toolkit to convert HTK slf to Julian dfa (separate kit)

  o  Embedding HTK Acoustic Parameters:
     - add option to load HTK Config file to set correct acoustic parameter
       configuration at recognition time. 
     - the acoustic parameter configuration can be embedded into
       header of a binary HMM file.

  o  Improved Word Graph:
     - add an option to completely separate graph words: words with
       different phone contexts can be output separatedly by
       "-graphrange -1".

  o  Support for online energy normalization:
     - Preliminary support for live recognition using acoustic model with
       energy normalization. (approximate with maximum energy of last input)

  o  Code refinements:
     - re-organize libsent/src/wav2mfcc.
     - modularize acoustic parameter (Value) handling.
     - output compile-time configuration of libsent with "--setting" option.
     - Doxygen 1.5.0 support.
     - "julius-info@lists.sourceforge.jp" becomes the official contact address.
     - fixed typo on copyright notice.

  o  Fixed bugs:
     - sometimes unable to read a binary LM on "--enable-words-int".
     - memory leaks around option handling, global variables and local buffers.
     - segmentation fault on very long input.
     - doublely counted initial state of DFA.
     - mkdfa.pl: unable to find mkfa on some OS.
     - adintool: makes empty output file on termination.
     - adintool: miss last inputs when killed.
     - other small changes.
</pre>
<u>3.5.2</u> (2006.07.31)
<pre>  o  Speed-up and improvement on Windows console:
     - Support DirectSound for better input handling
     - Support input threading utilizing callback API on portaudio.
     - Support newest MinGW (tested on 5.0.2)

  o  More accurate word graph output:
     - Add option to cut the resulting graph by its depth
       (option -graphcut, and enabled by default!)
     - Set limit for post-processing loop to avoid infinite loop
       (option -graphboundloop, and set by default)
     - Refine graph generation algorithm concerning dynamic word merging
       and search termination on the second pass.

  o  Add capability to output word graph instead of trellis on 1st pass:
     - 1st pass generates word graph instead of word trellis as
       intermediate result by specifying "--enable-word-graph".
       In that case, the 2nd pass will be restricted on the graph, not
       on the whole trellis.
     - With "--enable-word-graph" and "--enable-wpair" option, the
       first pass of Julius can perform 1-pass graph generation based
       on 2-gram with basically the same algorithm as other popular
       word graph based decoders.

  o  Bug fixes:
     - configure script did not work on Solaris 8/9
     - "-gprune none" did not work on tied-mixture AM
     - Incorrect error message for AM with duration header other than "NULLD"
     - Always warns about zero frame stripping upon MFCC

  o  Imprementation improvements:
     - bmalloc2-based AM memory management
</pre>
<u>3.5.1</u> (2006.03.31)
<pre>  o  Wider MFCC types support:
     - Added extraction of acceleration coefficients (_A).  Now you
       can recognize waveform or microphone input with AM trained with _A.
     - Support all MFCC qualifiers (_0, _E, _N, _D, _A, _N, _Z) and their
       combination 
     - Support for any vector lenth (will be guessed from AM header)
     - New option: "-accwin"
     - New option "-zmeanframe": frame-wise DC offset removal, like HTK
     - New options to specify detailed analysis parameters (see manual):
          -preemph, -fbank, -ceplif, -rawe / -norawe, 
          -enormal / -noenormal, -escale, -silfloor

  o Improved microphone / network recognition by MAP-CMN:
     - New option "-cmnmapweight" to change MAP weight
     - Option "-cmnload" can be used to specify the initial cepstral
       mean at startup
     - Cepstral mean of last 5 second input is used as an initial mean
       for each input.  You can inhibit updating of the initial mean
       and keep the value loaded by "-cmnload" by option "-cmnnoupdate".

  o Module issue:
     - Julius now outputs "<startproc>" when recognition starts, and
       "<stopproc>" after recognition stopped by module command.
       Use this for safer server-client synchronization.
     - now can specify grammar name from client by specifying a name
       after a command like "ADDGRAM name" or "CHANGEGRAM name".

  o Bug fixes:
     - Sometimes segfault on pause/resume command on module mode while input.
     - Can not read N-gram with tuples &gt; 2^24.
     - Can not read HMM with 3-state (1 output state) model on multi-path.
     - Sometimes omit the last transition definition in DFA file.
     - Sometimes fails to compile the gramtools on MacOSX.
</stopproc></startproc></pre>
<u>3.5</u> (2005.11.11)
<pre>  o  New features:
     - Input verification / rejection using GMM (-gmm, -gmmnum, -gmmreject)
     - Word graph output (--enable-graphout, --enable-graphout-nbest)
     - Pruning on 2nd pass based on local posterior CM (--enable-cmthres)
     - Multiple/per-grammar recognition (-gram, -gramlist, -multigramout) 
     - Can specify multiple grammars at startup: "-gram prefix1,prefix2,..."
       or "-gramlist listfile" where listfile contains list of prefixes.
     - General output character set conversion "-charconv from to"
       based on iconv (Linux) or Win32API+libjcode (Windows)

  o  Improved audio inputs on Linux:
     - ALSA-1.x support. (--with-mictype=alsa)
     - EsounD daemon input support. (--with-mictype=esd)
     - Fixed some bugs on USB audio input.
     - Audio capturing device can be specified via env. "AUDIODEV".
     - Extra microphone API support using portaudio and spLib API.

  o  Performance improvements:
     - Reduced memory size for beam operation on the 1st pass.
     - Slightly optimized tree lexicon by removing redundant data.
     - Reduced size of word N-gram index (reduced from 32 bit to 24 bit).

  o  Fixed bugs:
     - Not working spectral subtraction.
     - Memory leak when stack exhausted ("stack empty") on 2nd pass.
     - Segmentation fault on a very short input of 1 to 4 frames.
     - AM trained with no CMN cannot be used with waveform/mic input.
     - Wrong short-pause word handling on successive decoding mode.
       (--enable-sp-segment)
     - No output of "maxcodebooksize" at startup.
     - No output of the number of sentences found when stack exhausted.
     - No output of "-separatescore" on module mode.
     - Beam width does not adjusted when grammar has been changed and 
       full beam options (-b 0) is specified in Julian.
     - Wrong update of category-aware cross-word triphones when
       dynamically switching grammar on Julian.
     - No output of grammar to stdout on multiple grammar mode.
     - Unable to send/receive audio data between different endian machines.
     - (Linux) crash when compiled with icc.
     - (Linux) some strange behavior on USB audio.
     - (Windows) confuse with CR/LF newline inputs in several text inputs.
     - (Windows) mkdfa.pl could not work on cygwin.
     - (Windows) sometimes fails to read a file when not using zlib.
     - (Windows) wrong file suffix when recording with "-record" (.raw-&gt;.wav)

  o  Unified source code:
     - Linux and Windows version are integrated into one source.
     - Multi-path version has been integrated with the normal version
       into one source.  The multi-path version of Julius/Julian, that
       allows any transitions of HMMs including model skip transition,
       can be compiled by "--enable-multipath" option.  The part of
       source codes for the multi-path version can be identified 
       by the definition "MULTIPATH_VERSION".

  o  Other improvements:
     - Now can be compiled on MinGW/MSYS on Windows
     - Totally rewritten comments in entire source in Doxygen format.
       You can generate fully browsable source documents in English.
       Try "make doxygen" at the top directory (you need doxygen installed)
     - Install additional executables of julius/julian with version and setting
       names like "julius-3.5-fast" when "make install" is invoked.
     - Updated LICENSE.txt with English translation for reference.

  o  Changed behaviors:
     - Binary N-gram file format has been changed for smaller size.
       The old files can still be read directly by julius, in which
       case on-line conversion will be performed at startup.
       You can convert the old files (3.4.2 and earlier) to the new
       format with the new mkbingram by involing the command below:
	       "mkbingram -d oldbinary newbinary"
       Please note that since mkbingram now output the new format
       file, it can not be read by older Julius.
       The binary N-gram file version can be detected by the first 17
       bytes of the file: old format should be "julius_bingram_v3" and
       new format should be "julius_bingram_v4".
     - Byte order of audio stream via tcpip fixed to LITTLE ENDIAN.
     - Now use built-in zlib by default for compressed files.  This may
       make the engine startup slower, and if you prefer, you can still
       use the previous method using external gzip command by specifying
       "--disable-zlib".
     - (Windows) Changed the compilation procedure on VC++.  You can build
       Julian by only specifying "-DBUILD_JULIAN" at compiler option,
       and do not need to alter "julius.h".

- More stable PAUSE/RESUME on module mode with adinnet input.
- Bug fixes:
  - Memory leak on very short input.
  - Missing Nth result when small vocabulary is used.
  - Hang up of "generate" on small grammar.

<u>3.4.1</u> (2004.02.25)
<pre>- Search algorithm is slightly modified to make search more stable at
  of 2nd pass.  These modification are enabled by default, and
  MAY IMPROVE THE RECOGNITION ACCURACY as compared with older versions.
  - fixed overcounting of LM score for the expanded word.
  - new inter-word triphone approximation (-iwcd1 best #) on 1st
    pass.  This new algorithm now becomes default.
- Newly supports binary HMM (original format, not compatible with HTK).
  A tool "mkbinhmm" converts a hmmdefs(ascii) file to the binary format.
- MFCC computation becomes faster by sin/cos table lookup.
- Bugs below have been fixed:
  - (-input adinnet) recognition does not start immediately after speech
		     inputs begin when using adinnet client.
  - (-input adinnet) together with module mode, speech input cannot
		     stop by pause/terminate command.
  - (-input adinnet) unneccesary fork when connecting with adinnet client.
  - (-input rawfile) error in reading wave files created by Windows
                     sound recorder.
  - (CMN) CMN was applied any time even when acoustic models does not want.
  - (AM) numerous messages in case of missing triphone errors at startup.
  - (adintool) immediately exit after single file input.
  - (sp-segment) fixed many bugs relating short pause word and LM
  - (sp-segment) wow it works with microphone input.
  - (-[wps]align) memory leak on continuous input.
- Add option to remove DC offset from speech input (option -zmean).
- (-module) new output message:
  '&lt;INPUTPARAM FRAMES="input_frame_length" MSEC="length_in_msec"&gt;'
- Optional feature "Search Space Visualization" is added (--enable-visualize)
- HTML documentations greatly revised in doc.

New argument: "-iwcd1 best #" "-zmean"
New configure option: "--disable-lmfix", "--enable-visualize"
</pre>
<u>3.4</u> (2003.10.01)
<pre>- Confidence measure support
  - New parameter "-cmalpha" as smoothing coef.
  - New command "-outcode C" to output CM in module output
  - Can be disabled by configure option "--disbale-cm"
  - Can use an alternate CM algorithm by configure option "--enable-cm-nbest"
- Class N-gram support
  - Can be disabled by configure option "--disable-class-ngram"
  - Factoring basis changed from N-gram entry to dictionary word
- WAV format recording in "adinrec", "adintool" and "-record" option
- Modified output message
    startup messages,
    engine configuration message in --version and --help,
- Fixes:
    some outputs in module mode,
    bug in only several frame input (realtime-1stpass.c),
    long silence at end of segmented speech
    miscompilation with NetAudio,
    word size check in binary N-gram,
    bug in acoustic computation (gprune_none.c).
    "-version" -&gt; "-setting", "-hipass" -&gt; "-hifreq", "-lopass" -&gt; "-lofreq"
</pre>
<u>3.3p4</u> (2003.05.06)
<pre>- Fixes around audio input:
  - Fix segfault/hangup when microphone input runs for a long period.
  - Fix client hangup when input speech is too long in module mode.
    (now send an buffer overflow message to the client instead of hangup)
  - Fix audio buffering for very short input (&lt;1000 samples).
  - Fix blocking in tcpip adin.
- Some cosmetic changes (jcontrol, LOG_TEN, etc.)
</pre>
<u>3.3p3</u> (2003.01.10)
<pre>- New inter-word short pause handling:
  - [Julius] New option added for short pause handling.  Specifying
    "-iwspword" adds a short-pause word entry, namely "<unk> [sp] sp sp",
    to the dictionary.  The entry content to be changed by using "-iwspentry".
  - [multi-path] Supports inter-word context-free short pause handling.
    "-iwsp" option automatically appends a skippable short pause model at
    every word end.  The added model will also be ignored in context
    modeling.  The short pause model to be appended by "-iwsp" can be
    specified by "-spmodel" options.  See documents for details.
- Fixes for audio input:
   - Input delay improved: the initial response to mic input now
     becomes much faster than previous versions (200ms -&gt; 50ms approx.).
   - Would not block when other process is using the audio device, but
     just output error and exit.
   - Update support for libsndfile-1.0.x.
   - Update support for ALSA-0.9.x 
     (to use this, add "--with-mictype=alsa" to configure option.)

<pre>- This patch fixes compilation error with libsndfile &gt; 1.0.x.
</pre>
<u>3.3p2</u> (2002.11.18)
<pre>- Newly supports model-skip transition.  From this version, you can
  use "any" type of state transition in HTK format for acoustic model.
  (see Bugs above for limitation).
- add new feature: "-record dir" records speech inputs sucessively
  into the specified directory.
- fix segfault on Solaris with "-input mfcfile".
- fix adin-cut bug when using module mode and adinnet together.
- fix output flush after last recognition output.
</pre>
