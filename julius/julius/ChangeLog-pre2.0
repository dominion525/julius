	implemented (-DLOGTABLE in lib/Makefile).

	* factoring_sub.c (max_successor_prob): experimantal 1-gram
	factoring is implemented (-DUNIGRAM_FACTORING)

Wed Jan  6 14:56:37 1999  Akinobu Lee  <ri@uffizi>

	* main.c (opt_parse): New Feature: "-separatescore" outputs each
	AM score and LM score separatedly.  Of course it has no effect
	with DFA.  Output will change like this:
	    score1: -9266.944336
	 -> score1: -9266.944336 (AM: -8995.933594 LM: -271.010406)
	Note that LM is a scaled value.

	* lib/hmminfo/hmm_lookup.c (hmm_make_ptree): Cosmetic changes in
	startup total HMM nums messages.

	* lib/anlz/rddata.c (strip_zero): strip_zero become selectable in
	DEFS: -DSTRIP_ZERO.  This may be defined in Julian, but not needed
	for Julius for some temporary reason.

	* main.c (main): disable experimantal ZMEANSOUCE support.

	* main.c (usage): Avoid naming conflict in "-input".  Now change
	"mfc"->"mfcfile", "file"->"rawfile", and "-input mfcfile" is
	default.  The old name "mfc" and "file" still remains valid for
	backward compatibility.

Mon Jan  4 19:37:09 1999  LEE Akinobu  <ri@sunlight.kuis.kyoto-u.ac.jp>

	* (Total) move include files: include/sent/wchmm.h -> ./wchmm.h
	all include entries are gathered to one file, "julius.h".
	Now toplevel sources should include only this header.

	* Introduced experimental implementation of trellis visualization
 	on X11.  To experience this feature, define TREVIS_INC and
 	TREVIS_LIB in Makefile correctly, and invoke with option "-V".
 	New source file has been added: trevis_x11.c

Mon Dec 21 11:06:32 1998  Akinobu Lee  <ri@uffizi>

	* beam.c (bt_current_max_word): Now output temporarily best word
 	hypotheses for each frame with "-debug" option.

	* lib/voca/voca_util.c (print_voca_info): Now output total state
	num at startup time.

Fri Dec 18 15:14:52 1998  Akinobu Lee  <ri@uffizi>

	* search_bestfirst.c (wchmm_fbs): BUGFIX: (DFA) hypotheses whose
	score <= LOG_ZERO has been expanded on the 2nd pass.

Wed Dec 16 10:59:16 1998  Akinobu Lee  <ri@uffizi>

	* beam.c (get_back_trellis_proceed): BUGFIX: Fix typo for
 	WPAIR+DFA
	(init_nodescore): BUGFIX: the initial node has been created
 	multiply for NOT CATEGOTY_TREE on 1st pass DFA.

Sun Dec 13 01:23:36 1998  LEE Akinobu  <ri@sunlight.kuis.kyoto-u.ac.jp>
	[JULIUS 1.2 patchlevel 1 / JULIAN 1.1 release.]

	* lib/util/endian.c (swap_bytes): add this generic byte-order
 	changing function.

	* lib/anlz/rdparam.c (read_param): Now JULIUS/JULIAN assumes big
	endian MFCC as input when "-input mfc".  The wrong little-endian
	MFCC, typically generated by "wav2mfcc", can still be read by
	heuristic auto-detection function in read_param().

Tue Nov 17 09:33:04 1998  Akinobu Lee  <ri@uffizi>

	* main.c (main): make sure stdout is flushed after processing each
	input. 

	* include/sent/dfa.h: DFA_MAXTERMNUM is now eliminated.

	* lib/dfa/rddfa.c (rddfa): DFA_MAXTERMNUM not needed. Eliminated.

Mon Nov 16 16:48:12 1998  Akinobu Lee  <ri@uffizi>

	* search_bestfirst.c (next_word): (USE_DFA) temporary seek for
	entire input.

	* lib/hmminfo/hmm_lookup.c (hmm_make_ptree): more fix.
	physical tree and logical tree are now merged so that search ends
	in one query.  Now HMMlist don't need all HMMs,
	only logical->physical mappings will suffice.

Sun Nov 15 19:12:41 1998  Akinobu Lee  <ri@uffizi>

	* Makefile: re-link adin_mic_linux.c -> adin_mic_linux_oss.c

Sat Nov 14 17:12:52 1998  Akinobu Lee  <ri@chip>

	* lib/hmminfo/hmm_lookup.c(htk_hmmdata_lookup_logical()): Fall to
	htk_hmmdata_lookup_physical() when not found in logical.  Safe in
	case defined HMMs are not in HMMlist(Warning will be displayed).

	* Makefile: add ALSA target (linux-alsa)
	* adin_mic_alsa.c: mic interface with ALSA lib
